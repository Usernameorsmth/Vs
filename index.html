                <h2> Facts about cats</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth.<br>
When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level.<br>
A group of cats is called a “clowder”.<br>
Cats make about 100 different sounds.<br>
Cats have over 30 muscles that control their ears.<br>
